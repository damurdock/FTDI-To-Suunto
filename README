 This project is an FTDI to Suunto Dive Computer adaptor based off of Roli Wasmer's USB-based design (found here: http://homepage.hispeed.ch/scubadiver/). I made it because I wanted to download dive computer data from my Suunto Cobra dive computer, but my official adaptor was broken. Replacements are almost $100 US. I modified the schematic  because I already owned several FTDI USB to TTL adaptors, and that makes up half of the design, so I figured that I could save money by cutting out the FTDI chip and breaking out the connectors to a header. 
 
 Legal note: Right now, I'm shopping around for a license to put this under. Until then, please don't modify my designs. I promise the final designs will be open hardware of some type.
